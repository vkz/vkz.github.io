Corporate ladder
----------------
Dec 2019-now
:   *Director* and *sole proprietor* at
    Fullmeta Capital Ltd
    (London, UK)
    
    Contracting gigs with startups and financial institutions.

    \

Jul-Dec 2019
:   *Senior Programmer* at
    [All Street Research](https://www.allstreet.org)
    (London, UK)

    Building cognitive assistant for investment research in
    Clojure(Script). Front and back, AI, NLP, and more buzzwords here.

    \

Apr-Nov 2017
:   *Senior Programmer* at
    [Droit](http://droitfintech.com/)
    (London, UK)

    Same as before but with obligatory daily commute.

    \

2015-2017
:   *Programmer/Consultant* at
    [Droit](http://droitfintech.com/)
    (remote and New York, USA)

    Building an expert system for compliant trading. Sneaking Clojure(Script) into
    unsuspecting financial giants. On any given day I could be designing DSLs,
    implementing compilers, parsers, rule-based engines, putting together simple
    browser-based GUIs and whatever else the startup life would have me do.

    \

2014-2015
:   *Programmer* at
    [Yandex](https://company.yandex.com/)
    (Moscow, Russia).

    Officially a member of *Search Interfaces Development Infrastructure* group,
    but mostly I wrote backend tools for source to source compilation - engines to
    write your template engines. If I were lucky and did it right frontend
    developers would get to use my work and take all the credit.

    \

2009-2011
:   *Equity Derivatives & Structured Products Sales* at
    [Renaissance Capital](https://www.rencap.com/InvestmentBanking/About/)
    (Moscow, Russia).

    \

2007-2009
:   *EM Structured Solutions and Derivatives Sales* at
    [Barclays Capital](http://investmentbank.barclays.com/markets.html)
    (London, UK).



Sample Projects
---------------
Emacs Lisp
:   *Author* of [multi.el](https://github.com/vkz/multi) - all things multiple
    dispatch for Emacs Lisp: type driven dispatch with *protocols*, ad-hoc
    polymorphism with *multi-methods*, pattern-matching and destructuring without
    noise with *multi-patterns*, case-dispatch with *multi-defuns*, benchmarking
    with *multi-benchmarks*.

    \

Racket
:   *Author* of [tilda](https://github.com/vkz/tilda) an opinionated threading
    macro with self-documenting hole-markers, clause level keyword options and an
    implicit escape continuation.

    \

    *Author* of
    [racket/tables](https://github.com/vkz/tables/blob/master/tables/main.rkt)
    that extends Racket with first class Lua-style meta-tables for
    prototypal inheritance, generic associative API and more. Watch my
    [RacketCon'19](https://youtu.be/sy2TzZO70E4) talk.

    \

    *Author* of [ponzi](https://github.com/vkz/ponzi) - the beginnings of a clever
    Scheme for a discerning smart contract builder. WIP but it does implement the
    Ethereum Virtual Machine close enough to the Yellow Paper.

    \

    *Author* of [ometa-racket](https://github.com/vkz/ometa-racket), a mostly
    complete Racket implementation of
    [OMeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta) - OO pattern-matching language
    that extends PEGs with ability to handle left-recursive rules and match
    structured data.

    \

    *Author* of [skish](https://github.com/vkz/skish), a mostly futile attempt at
    porting Olin Shivers' wonderful [scsh](http://scsh.net/) to Racket. scsh is
    a non-interactive Unix shell embedded within Scheme (originally Scheme48).

    \

    *Contributor* to Racket the language.

    \

Clojure
:    *Author* of [fullmeta
     web](https://github.com/vkz/fullmeta/tree/master/clj/src/fullmeta) -
     Dynamic language deserves a dynamic web "framework": load www
     routes from Clojure namespaces "on the fly" - CGI style; render
     HTML and CSS. Utility-first local CSS vs selector-targeting is a
     stupid dichotomy - allow both! Other goodies: multi methods with
     per-position :default; helpful prelude functions, etc.

    \
    
    *Author* of several closed-source products: FpML message parser, financial
    derivatives classifier based on ISDA taxonomies, legal annotation tools, PDF
    and XML content extractor and transformation tools.

    \

    *Author* of [bot](https://github.com/vkz/bot) - a crypto-currency
    arbitrager that could talk to several exchanges including Bitfinex and GDAX.
    It uses Clojure Spec to parse and validate protocol messages and
    [aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph) for async communication and
    concurrency.

    \

    *Author* of [playrum](https://github.com/vkz/playrum) - just getting the taste
    for React in ClojureScript.

    \

    *Contributor* to [seqexp](https://github.com/cgrand/seqexp/pull/6), regular
    expressions for Clojure sequences.

    \

Guile Scheme
:   I use GNU Guix OS for bit-for-bit reproducible packaging,
    containerized dev work and deployments. My entire OS and dev
    environments can be instantiated from the Scheme code I write.

    \
    
    Unless you're Google-scale I am positive I can do better than k8s and opaque
    Docker images with a dash of Scheme code.
    
    \

JavaScript
:   *Author* of [bemhtml-syntax](https://github.com/vkz/bemhtml-syntax), a syntax
    converter for [BEMHTML](https://en.bem.info/) - an XSLT inspired templating
    language - part of [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/method/) of
    frontend development.

    \

    *Author* of
    [bemhtml-source-convert](https://github.com/vkz/bemhtml-source-convert), a
    *best effort* compiler from [BEMHTML](https://en.bem.info/) templates to
    [BH](https://github.com/bem/bh) templates.

    \

    *Author* of [xjst-more](https://github.com/vkz/xjst-more), an
    [XJST](https://github.com/veged/xjst)-based compiler for BEMHTML templates
    that facilitates incremental compilation of templates potentially on the
    Client. WIP.

    \

    *Contributor* to [ometa-js](https://github.com/veged/ometa-js), a JavaScript
    implementation of [OMeta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta).

    \

    *Contributor* to [bem-xjst](https://github.com/bem/bem-xjst), XJST-based
    compiler for BEMHTML templates.

    How I was introduced to programming. [Assorted solutions to HtDP](https://github.com/vkz/HtDP).


Languages
---------

Russian, English
:   What you'll hear me speak on Zoom calls.

Clojure
:   What I get to use on the job most often.

Racket
:   Used to be my favorite, but I tend to choose simpler tools now.

Emacs Lisp
:   Unavoidable Lisp for a pro Emacs user. Surprisingly fun & productive.

Guile Scheme
:   Unavoidable Scheme for a pro Guix user. Lively.

JavaScript
:   Wrote fair amount, mostly backend Node.js. I prefer ClojureScript.

TCL
:   Happy parallel universe with Shell scripts gone. Deserves more praise

OMeta
:   Extensive experience writing parsers with complex and context dependent grammars.

Redex
:   Can implement executable semantics for your pet-language or DSL.

Java
:   Enough to write a Clojure wrapper with necessary bindings.

C
:   Enough to pass a systems programming class but not nearly enough to actually use it.

Factor, OCaml, Lua, Rust, Shen, Erlang (via LFE)
:   Toyed with but never used in earnest. I [ported](https://github.com/vkz/prelude/blob/master/tables.rkt) some good ideas from Lua to Racket and contributed a patch to [racer-rust](https://github.com/racer-rust/racer). Would love to use Erlang via LFE professionally.



Other tools
-----------

Managed and deployed OpenBSD and FreeBSD boxes but prefer Scheme code
targeting GNU Guix. I programmed against Kafka, Elastic Search, Mongo,
PG, SQLite. I am intimately familiar with Datomic and Datascript graph
databases. I don't do YAML, Docker, k8s nor should you.


On interviews
-------------

_NB UK/EU recruiters: I am expensive_


_NB recruiters: liaise this section with your client_


I hired and put together successful engineering teams from nothing.
Interviewing is hard - I get it. That doesn't mean you should be
throwing random puzzles at me, unless the job specifically calls for
"tip of your fingers" algorithmic knowledge rather than asking
Wikipedia. I encourage you to look at my code and pair program a
feature or debug something in one of my current projects. I'll happily
give you a choice of interesting problems we can work on. You'll get
to see me program computers and I'll enjoy a feature or bugfix. Take
home problems are fine, but must be paid for at my usual contracting
rate.


Activities and interests
------------------------

Most of my activities and interests these days involve boxes with lights and
buttons. Even so there were reports of me cycling, bouldering, surfing,
roller-skating, skiing and more. Having owned a sports car I'll choose a bicycle
every time.

Lived in the UK, US, Hungary, Spain and far more exotic places. Crossed the US from
Mexico to Canada twice with the current state count of 19.
